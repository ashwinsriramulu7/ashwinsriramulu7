### 🧠 Research Overview

I am an undergraduate researcher at the **AI RoboLab, Department of Computational Intelligence, SRMIST**.  
My work focuses on **machine learning for industrial systems, prognostics, and autonomous machinery**.

I am particularly interested in:
- Reliable machine intelligence  
- Health monitoring and RUL prediction  
- Real-time, edge-deployable ML  
- Safe and resilient autonomous architectures  

Much of my work is conducted within ongoing research projects or collaborations, and is released selectively after review or approval.
